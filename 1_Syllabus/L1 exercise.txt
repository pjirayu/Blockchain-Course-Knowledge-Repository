1.
Problem = Latency
Commit fraud (cheat) = Hide the transaction

2.
Problem = more Latency
Cf = harder bcuz there is cross-checking between 2 ledgers

3. (1)
Problem = If there are a lot of blocks and each block is equal, single ledger can't check block to whom owns the once. 
Cf = The ledger can send any the user with equal amount of block but that block is not own there.

4. (2)
Problem = Latency of cross-checking between two ledger
Cf = the cheating is harder than (3) bcuz two ledger have to cross-checking the tranactions block that is corresponding or not?
moreover, two ledger might note not matching bcuz some ledger wanna cheat.

5.
- every block have to check altogether, can't add or substract amount (imutability) in each block until there are transaction required and every block have to cooperate checking.
- physicial issues (e.g. privacy)
